# Auditing Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a Web3 security researcher actively participating in audit contests across Sherlock, Cantina, Codehawks and Code4rena. I specialize in discovering logic bugs, smart contract vulnerabilities, and gas inefficiencies in Solidity-based projects.

## ⏳ Pending Results

These are contests I’ve recently participated in. Awaiting final rankings:

| Contest | Language / Stack | Platform | Notes |

##  What's Next
I'm actively looking to:
- Join audit teams (part-time or full-time)
- Take up freelance audits
- Publish more profound vulnerability writeups

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or connect!
