# Auditing Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a Web3 security researcher actively participating in audit contests across Sherlock, Cantina, and Code4rena. I specialize in discovering logic bugs, smart contract vulnerabilities, and gas inefficiencies in Solidity-based projects.

##  What's Next
I'm actively looking to:
- Join audit teams (part-time or full-time)
- Take up freelance audits
- Publish more profound vulnerability writeups

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or connect!
